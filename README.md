# dotfiles

Dotfiles and configs for various shells, apps, and OSes.

The installer does not work by replacing your existing dotfiles.
Instead, a command is added to them to import the dotfiles within this repo.
This way, you can still have machine specific configuration in your home dotfiles.

## Install

Install using Python (>=3.6)

```shell
python -m installer
```
